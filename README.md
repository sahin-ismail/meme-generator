# Hackathon Online Platform
I joined Google Cloud an I deployed my application on Google App Engine.

You can access my application from the link https://meme-generator-310823.uc.r.appspot.com/.

I built my application using Node JS. I have used javascript, jquery, html, css, bootstrap and similar programming languages, libraries and technologies.

I wrote all the codes. I used the API at https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen link specified in the homework pdf to generate a meme.

My application gets 3 inputs. These are for the upper part, the lower part, and the image. Image url input field is required. We can generate meme even when there are no other areas.

The meme generation phase may vary depending on the size of the picture. This is related to the api I use and the speed at which the data is sent.
